Getting asked questions that are covered in documentation

Covering a robust, versatile structure for content

Why? What? How? What if/next?

# Why?

Why learn this thing? Solves x problem, is cool, better method than others.
Why listen to me?
Why spend the time to read this guide?

Adults learn things in order to do stuff. Children will soak up general knowledge. If people aren't reading your stuff, you might not be presenting this well enough

# What?

What is this? What are we doing?
Overview, high-level roadmap

This is where graphics and diagrams go

What do I need to know? Key concepts, clear up misconceptions, any assumed/pre-requisite knowledge

# How?

How do we do it? The step-by-step instructions
Don't allow yourself to go on tangets, break it into it's own piece of content.
If there are multiple ways to achieve an end goal, you want to provide one way to do it. People will get lost otherwise if you are vague or assume too much prior knowledge.

# What if? What Next?

What if somethign goes wrong?

What if I get stuck?
Provide where to go for help:
- troubleshooting references
- communities
- your contact details

What can you do now with this knowledge?

What ideas have yet to be explored?

What can you learn next?

The second to last block is the HOW
Step by step instructions. Headings are abreviated summaries of what each step is about.

The last block is the WHAT IF/NEXT
List of common pitfalls, descriptions of communities to get help from

# Where to start?

If you don't have content or it isn't working:
- Work with your audience
- Where are people struggling?
