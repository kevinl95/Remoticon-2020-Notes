# IC Reverse Engineering On a Shoestring 
Peter Bosch

Reverse engineering Pentium II (350nm process chip) bytecode

# Custom microscope

Microscopes are expensive

He figured out how to use a regular school-style biology microscope to look at the silicon and worked on hacking it to add additional light
Took the head off
Added a tube with holes for lights
A webcam on the top
Used the original eyepice and some plastic to embed an LED to pipe additional light into the optical pathway
A 45 degree element (beamsplitter) that directs half the light down into the silicon
He seems to have gotten a decent image, although it is saturated

Built a better version with a better microscope using a DSLR, an XYZ stage for scanning, and a better illumination element
This one produces an excellent image.

## Advantages over a soldering microscope
Light isn't coming in from the sides
Significantly better magnification

# Layer Removal Process

Many ICs have many layers

He uses glass polish and a q-tip to gently polish away layers of the chip
Plastic cases are ideal since they can usually just be split open
Older chips are better since they have simpler and larger structures, often with just one metal layer
