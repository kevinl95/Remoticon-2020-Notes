# Vegan Vampires made Vividly Visible
Saad Chinoy

Belongs to a food hacking group called Guthub.

Studied bioluminesence. Birds for example look more colorful and bright in the UV spectrum

Wondered if food would look different in the UV spectrum

Tonic water becomes a bright opaque blue

Made patterns out of plastic and embedded secret messages visible in UV using agar (seaweed product similar to gelatin)
